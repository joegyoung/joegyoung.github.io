I am implementing a Website for my Ruby projects. I am interested in building GUI Web Interfaces. I have had 10ish years using PHP personally and switched to RUBY. I have used Ruby to migrate Oregon City's School District's Google Docuements from separate Domains to a single Google Domain with the Staff accounts. This allows for Google Class room and to easilier share documents between teachers and students.
